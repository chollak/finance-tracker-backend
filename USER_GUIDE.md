- Mention merchant: "Starbucks 500" helps categorization

- Set realistic amounts based on past spending
- Review Budget Alerts weekly
- Adjust budgets monthly based on Dashboard insights

**Efficient Workflow:**
- Use voice for quick logging on-the-go
- Use web app for detailed review and editing
- Check Dashboard weekly for financial health

### 10. Troubleshooting

**"No transactions found in your message"**
→ Include amount and category: "Coffee 500"

**Transaction categorized incorrectly**
→ Click Edit → Change category → AI learns from correction

**Can't delete transaction**
→ Only most recent transaction can be deleted via bot
→ Use web app to delete any transaction

**Web app not loading**
→ Check WEB_APP_URL environment variable
→ Try /start command again

**Voice not recognized**
